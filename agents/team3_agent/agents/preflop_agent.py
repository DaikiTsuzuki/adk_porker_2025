      "amount": <number>,
      "reasoning": "Detailed explanation including hand rank, position consideration, and strategic reasoning."

      "success": false,
      "action": "fold",
      "amount": 0,
      "reasoning": "Error description or reason for failure"
    }

    - Include tool results in your reasoning
    - Strictly follow JSON format
    - Never transfer to other agents
    - CRITICAL: If you cannot process the request, return a valid JSON with success: false and fold action instead of transferring""",
